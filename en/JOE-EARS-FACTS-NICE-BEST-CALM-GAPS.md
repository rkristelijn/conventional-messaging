# Leave JOE at Home: Judgments, Opinions, Evaluations
When someone tells you something, set aside your own thoughts about it for a moment. This allows you to listen with an open attitude to what the other person is saying.

# Avoid GAPS: Guessing, Assuming, Presuming, Speculating
We often fill in others' intentions. This causes a lot of miscommunication and dissatisfaction between people. Prevent this by asking what the other person means.

# Use EARS: Engage, Ask, Reflect, Summarize
Listen openly to the other person, summarize the story briefly, and check if your summary is correct. Ask further if something is unclear or needs more attention.

# Remember FACTS: Find, Ask, Confirm, Trust, Share
Never assume that you understand what someone means. Words have slightly different meanings for everyone. Regularly check if your interpretation is correct.

# Be NICE: Neutral, Inquisitive, Curious, Engaged
Listening to others with an open attitude can create an honest conversation. Genuine curiosity fosters a connection between people.

# Embrace BEST: Build on Efforts, Strengths, and Triumphs
People often focus on what went wrong, even in communication. And that's okay, as you can learn from it. But also look at what went well. This increases the sense of shared success and shifts the focus to positivity.

# Be CALM: Consider, Acknowledge, Let Go, Move On
Does a conversation evoke emotions? Sometimes it's good to discuss this with the other person. And sometimes it's better to handle these emotions on your own. Not everything needs to be analyzed in detail. Recognize and acknowledge what was said and how it affected you. Then let it go and move on.
