# Conventional Messaging

[Nederlandse Versie](./README-nl.md)

When messaging there are general 'rules' that you want to play by. This project aims to be a one stop reference for all the communication issues, so you can just say 'No shouting please' or refer to 'Flooding'.

Scope: Any chat platform, professional or private

## Don't

1. Shouting: USE ALL CAPS - by convention this means screaming
2. Passive Aggressive: ? or ! as a full message - by convention this is passive aggressive
3. Argument enders: end short messages with a dot. (.) - by convention this means 'end of argument'
4. Long stories without any punctuation that are hard to read and gives a monotome style - Use punctuation appropriatry
5. Mixed Caps: uSe Of M1x3d caps or leetspeak - hard to read
6. Hashtag misuse: Using hashtags like #yolo, #metoo, #sorrynotsorry, #blessed, #foodporn #nofilter #fml. They are not needed.
7. Amibiguous emojis: 🍆 of 🍑 or combo's: 🍑 🍆, ✊🏼💦😝, 🚪🏃‍♀️💨
8. Flooding: send more than 3 texts without letting other people respond
9. Empty-reference: Saying read 'above' or somewhere vague and consider a genuine question properly answered by shaming the requester
